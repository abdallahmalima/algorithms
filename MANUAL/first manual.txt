...................ITERATIVE PRACTICE..............
1.Solve problem by iteratind 1D array by visit all/some elements
NOTE:solution is archived by either visit some/all elements depent of a problem
arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
EXAMPLES
(a) perfom lenear search on array;
(b) sum up array;


2.Solve problem by iteratind 1D array by re-visit all/some elements N times
NOTE:solution is archived by either re-visit some/all elements  N times depent on the problem
arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
EXAMPLES
(a) bubble sort;
(b) insertion sort;
(c) selection sort;


3.Solve problem by iterating 1D array by re-visit all/some elements for unknown time but end time must come
NOTE:solution is archived by either re-visit some/all elements  for unknown time means until the problem is solved depent on the problem
arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
EXAMPLES
(a) bubble sort;
(b) insertion sort;
(c) selection sort;
